ROAD ACCIDENT DASHBOARD (MICROSOFT EXCEL PROJECT)

In this project, I completed data cleaning tasks by identifying and correcting errors in the dataset, did data processing by adding customized columns, conducted data analysis using Pivot tables and Excel functions, and created data visualizations to extract insights. The insights gained from this analysis can guide the implementation of specific measures to improve road safety, reduce road accidents, and save lives.

⚙️ Steps Followed:

🔸 Requirement gathering from client

🔸 Identify the Stakeholders of the Project

🔸 Data Cleaning as per the requirement

🔸 Data Processing by adding some customized columns in data 

🔸 Data Analysis by Pivot Tables and Excel Functions 

🔸  Data Visualization to create charts and custom sheets to show the insights

🔎 Insights:

🔹 The total number of casualties that occurred after the accident- 4,17,883

🔹 Percentage of total casualties with respect to accident severity- Fatal (1.71%), Serious (14.19%), Slight (84.10%)

🔹 Maximum casualties by vehicle type- Car (79.80%)

🔹 Maximum casualties by road type- Single carriageway (16.12%)

🔹 Maximum casualties by road surface- Dry (66.87%)

🔹 Maximum casualties in light condition (Daylight/ Darkness)- Daylight (72.98%)

🔹 Maximum casualties in area (Urban/ Rural)- Urban (61.23%)

🔹 Maximum casualties in 2021 (Month)- November (9.44%)

🔹 Maximum casualties in 2022 (Month)- November (9.42%)

📊 Conclusion:

1. **Casualties Breakdown**: The dataset records a total of 417,883 casualties, categorized by severity as Fatal, Serious, and Slight.

2. **Primary Accident Type**: Car accidents account for the largest share of casualties, indicating the need for targeted safety measures in this category.

3. **Road Surface**: Most accidents occurred on dry road surfaces, underscoring the importance of maintaining road conditions for safety.

4. **Daylight Incidents**: The majority of accidents happened during daylight hours, suggesting potential areas for improved safety measures during other times of the day.

5. **Urban Areas**: Urban locations had the highest incidence of casualties, emphasizing the significance of urban road safety initiatives.

6. **Deadliest Month**: November consistently had the highest number of casualties in both 2021 and 2022, highlighting a recurring pattern that demands attention and intervention.

These insights can guide the implementation of specific measures to enhance road safety, reduce accidents, and ultimately save lives.
