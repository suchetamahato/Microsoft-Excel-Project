ROAD ACCIDENT DASHBOARD (MICROSOFT EXCEL PROJECT)

In this project, I performed data cleaning, processing, analysis, and visualization to extract insights from the road accident dataset.

⚙️ Steps Followed:

🔸 **Data Cleaning**: Identified and corrected errors in the dataset, ensuring data accuracy and reliability. I addressed issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

🔸 **Data Processing**: Added customized columns to the dataset, containing calculated or derived information relevant to the project's goals.

🔸 **Data Analysis**: Used tools like Pivot tables and Excel functions to perform data analysis.

🔸 **Data Visualization**: Created data visualizations, including charts, graphs, and tables, to present the analysis findings visually. These visualizations helped make the insights more accessible and understandable.

🔎 Insights:

🔹 The total number of casualties that occurred after the accident- 4,17,883

🔹 Percentage of total casualties with respect to accident severity- Fatal (1.71%), Serious (14.19%), Slight (84.10%)

🔹 Maximum casualties by vehicle type- Car (79.80%)

🔹 Maximum casualties by road type- Single carriageway (16.12%)

🔹 Maximum casualties by road surface- Dry (66.87%)

🔹 Maximum casualties in light condition (Daylight/ Darkness)- Daylight (72.98%)

🔹 Maximum casualties in area (Urban/ Rural)- Urban (61.23%)

🔹 Maximum casualties in 2021 (Month)- November (9.44%)

🔹 Maximum casualties in 2022 (Month)- November (9.42%)

📊 Conclusion:

1. **Casualties Breakdown**: The dataset records a total of 417,883 casualties, categorized by severity as Fatal, Serious, and Slight.

2. **Primary Accident Type**: Car accidents account for the largest share of casualties, indicating the need for targeted safety measures in this category.

3. **Road Surface**: Most accidents occurred on dry road surfaces, underscoring the importance of maintaining road conditions for safety.

4. **Daylight Incidents**: The majority of accidents happened during daylight hours, suggesting potential areas for improved safety measures during other times of the day.

5. **Urban Areas**: Urban locations had the highest incidence of casualties, emphasizing the significance of urban road safety initiatives.

6. **Deadliest Month**: November consistently had the highest number of casualties in both 2021 and 2022, highlighting a recurring pattern that demands attention and intervention.

These insights provide valuable information for developing strategies to improve road safety, decrease accident occurrences, and ultimately save lives.
