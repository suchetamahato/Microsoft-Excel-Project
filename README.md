ROAD ACCIDENT DASHBOARD (MICROSOFT EXCEL PROJECT)

As part of the project's objectives, I completed data cleaning tasks by identifying and correcting errors in the dataset, did data processing by adding customized columns, conducted data analysis using Pivot tables and Excel functions, and created data visualizations to extract insights. The insights gained from this analysis can guide the implementation of specific measures to improve road safety, reduce road accidents, and save lives.

âš™ Approach Followed:

ðŸ”¸ Requirement gathering from client

ðŸ”¸ Identify the Stakeholders of the Project

ðŸ”¸ Data Cleaning as per the requirement

ðŸ”¸ Data Processing by adding some customized columns in data 

ðŸ”¸ Data Analysis by Pivot Tables and Excel Functions 

ðŸ”¸  Data Visualization to create charts and custom sheets to show the insights

ðŸ”Ž Insights:

ðŸ”¹ The total number of casualties that occurred after the accident- 4,17,883

ðŸ”¹ Percentage of total casualties with respect to accident severity- Fatal (1.71%), Serious (14.19%), Slight (84.10%)

ðŸ”¹ Maximum casualties by vehicle type- Car (79.80%)

ðŸ”¹ Maximum casualties by road type- Single carriageway (16.12%)

ðŸ”¹ Maximum casualties by road surface- Dry (66.87%)

ðŸ”¹ Maximum casualties in light condition (Daylight/ Darkness)- Daylight (72.98%)

ðŸ”¹ Maximum casualties in area (Urban/ Rural)- Urban (61.23%)

ðŸ”¹ Maximum casualties in 2021 (Month)- November (9.44%)

ðŸ”¹ Maximum casualties in 2022 (Month)- November (9.42%)

ðŸ“Š Conclusion:

In the road accident, a staggering total of 4,17,883 casualties occurred, with severity levels of Fatal, Serious, and Slight. The most significant portion of casualties resulted from car accidents, mostly on single carriageways with dry road surfaces in daylight conditions. Urban areas saw the highest number of casualties, and November was the deadliest month in both 2021 and 2022.
